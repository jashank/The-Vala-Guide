The Vala Guide
==============

_The Vala Guide_ is a gentle introduction to programming with Vala.  The
groundwork was laid by Varun Madiath, and is currently being actively
developed by Jashank Jeremy.

To build it, grab this repository, ensure you have a sensible Make
(BSD Make and GNU Make are both supported), a sensible TeX
installation (I recommend TeX Live; you may have success with others),
and a fuctioning copy of Pygments and `minted`.  Run

    > make

You'll find your output in about twenty or thirty seconds in `valaguide.pdf`.
Enjoy!
